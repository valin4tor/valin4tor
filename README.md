I've worked at [Cleo AI](https://web.meetcleo.com/), [FT](https://www.ft.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Happiful](https://happiful.com/); now I [take photos](https://instagram.com/unidentified.systems) for a living.

I'm currently looking to collaborate on creative projects with likeminded folks.
